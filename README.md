# Conway's Game of Life - Super Pro Multi-Class

A dynamic and visually interactive implementation of Conway's Game of Life. This project combines the classic cellular automaton with a modern UI and theme switching, bringing a fun and educational simulation to life.

## Features:
- **Interactive Grid:** Click to toggle cell states and create initial patterns.
- **Game Controls:** Start, stop, step, clear, and randomize with ease.
- **Speed Control:** Adjust simulation speed with a slider.
- **Theming:** Switch between dark and light modes for a customized visual experience.
- **Save & Load:** Save your grid and load it later in JSON format.
- **Glider Insertion:** Quickly insert the famous "Glider" pattern to see how it evolves.

## Technologies:
- **Python** (Tkinter for UI)
- **Conway's Game of Life Logic**
- **Theming System (Dark & Light)**

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies (Tkinter should already be included in Python's standard library).
3. Run `python main.py` to start the simulation.

## Showcase:
Explore how simple rules lead to complex behavior with customizable options. Perfect for exploring cellular automata and game simulation concepts!
